# Health Check

A simple React app to use healthchecks.io to log network connectivity in the browser. Uses axios locally to attempt to hit endpoint, and healthchecks.io will log results from the cloud. Can be used to determine if network failure is local/vpn/provider.

Developed for use on a secure PC where the user has access to a browser but cannot run non-approved apps locally.
